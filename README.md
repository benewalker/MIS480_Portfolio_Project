Capstone Project—Business Intelligence Solution for U.S. Organization

The Capstone Project has four deliverables: a written BI solution, a presentation, an oral presentation, and a Self-Evaluation for the Capstone Project.

You have been hired as a consultant to present a BI solution for a U.S. Organization. The organization is interested in using business intelligence to help with strategic decision making and has asked you to demonstrate how BI tools can improve data analysis for issues or new theories. You will provide a written report as well as an oral presentation and recording to demonstrate how you would present your proposed BI solution to stakeholders of the U.S. Organization.

Your written BI solution should include:

Organization background and rationale for choosing it.
Description of business problem or new theory that will be addressed.
Explanation of data set chosen and how data can be accessed in real-time.
Description of BI tool(s) used to perform data analytics.
Explanation of code or functions used to evaluate data to perform different analytics types.
Description of data visualization tools (reports, dashboards, query) to communicate and display data analytics results.
Discussion of data analytics outcomes and benefits of using business intelligence.
Programming code and screenshots of data analysis outcomes, including the upload to GitHub.
Your written BI solution must be seven to ten pages in length in addition to a title and reference page and conform to the CSU Global Writing Center  (Links to an external site.). Include at least five scholarly references in addition to the course textbook. The CSU Global Library (Links to an external site.) is a good place to find these references.

Your BI Solution presentation should include:

15-20 slides with speaker notes on each slide.
A Reference slide with at least five scholarly or peer-reviewed sources. The CSU Global Library (Links to an external site.) is a good place to find these references.
Your presentation must be well-written and conform to the CSU Global Writing Center (Links to an external site.). For guidance on preparing a visual presentation, visit the library’s resources.  (Links to an external site.)

Your BI Solution recording should:

Be at least 10 minutes long.
You will need to practice your speech several times in Presenter Coach in Microsoft Office PowerPoint (Links to an external site.) to improve your delivery and presentation. Once you have improved your speech, you will record a video using your presentation slides and other materials using Screencast-O-Matic (Links to an external site.), Zoom (Links to an external site.), Google Hangouts, or other recording tools along with the webcam on your PC to record your presentation. You should be in your video presenting the speech. In order to submit your speech video recording, you may need to upload your speech to Google drive, One Drive, or you can try the Canvas direct submission. Depending on the size, Canvas may limit you on that upload. Uploading it to your YouTube Channel in an Unlisted posting is offered as an option. Make sure if you upload outside of Canvas that you share the link to your recording with your faculty member for reviewing.
Complete and attach Self-Evaluation for Capstone Project (Links to an external site.) detailing your experience and thoughts for improving your presentation for the next speech and submit. Include in the form the link to your video.
The following files will be helpful for completing this assignment:

Before you submit your Capstone Project, review the rubric for specific grading criteria to ensure you have met all project requirements. Also, attach all of your project deliverables – your written BI solution, presentation file, and Self-Evaluation form (Links to an external site.) (with link to the YouTube video) – before submitting the project.
